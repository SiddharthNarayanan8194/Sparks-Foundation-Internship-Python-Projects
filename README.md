# Sparks-Foundation-Python-Projects
Here, I have shown the tasks that I have completed during my internship at The Sparks Foundation #GRIPSEPT23 in the domain of Data Science & Business Analytics. The programming language used in this repository is Python (programming language) and the tasks have been documented using Google Colab which is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service.

The objectives of all the tasks are as follows:

Task 1: Prediction using Supervised ML;
Objective: To predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours studied using simple linear regression method.

Task 2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML;
Objective: From the given 'Iris' dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

Task 3: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Dataset 'SampleSuperstore'

Task 4: Perform 'Exploratory Data Analysis' on Dataset 'Global Terrorism'

Task 5: Perform 'Exploratory Data Analysis' on Dataset 'Indian Premier League'

Task 6: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm;
Objective: Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

Task 7: Stock Market Prediction using Numerical Analysis;
Objective: Create a model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices.
